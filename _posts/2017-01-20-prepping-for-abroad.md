I'm prepping for abroad! One of my biggest traveling weaknesses is packing at the last second (which I still haven't remedied...), but I'm actually planning lots of things ahead of time. For example, today I went out and, along with a few errands my mum wanted me to run, I bought some luggage tags (yeah, it was about time) and got some Euros because currency conversion is wack and crazy expensive!

Also, I'm just kind of testing out this blogging format. I'm hosting it for free with GitHub pages and using the static site generator, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It's pretty nifty and I can post about it some time if that's of interest...if anybody even reads this.
