<p>After our time in Vegesack, I unfortunately had to wake up at a reasonable hour to get to class. I'm going to miss class next Friday due to traveling, so I figured I should be responsible and go. It wasn't exciting in any way, but I went and felt good about it. The professor means well (as opposed to some on this campus) but is super boring. The professor before him was so awesome! He offered students a ride on his boat in the North Sea and stuff&mdash;pretty nify. Anyway, I left, went to lunch with the gang (Dariya, Renata, and Daniel), and packed my bags for Dublin. I caught the 2:37 train to Bremen Hbf, took the tram to the Flughafen (which was perfectly timed! Wonderful!), and tried to figure out the confusing airport that is Bremen. I'm so glad I don't use it very often. It's not the best.</p>

<p>I got past security much more quickly than I was expecting and went to sit in the terminal. UNLIKE PREVIOUS TRAVELS, I was prepared for this lull. I brought my iPad and played Risk on it...it was a great use of time. I totally could have studied for a test or practiced my German...psht, nah. I actually ended up sitting there for about 2 hours, only to take a 30 minute connecting flight to AMS. I had enough time to make my next plane, bought some food (EXPENSIVE AIRPORT FOOD *SHAKES FIST ANGRILY*), avoid these Chinese tourists that were <strong>YELLING</strong> near the gate, and board my flight as it started to get dark. The flight into Dublin was beautiful, and the experience wasn't terrible 10/10 would fly KLM again at this point.</p>

<p>Dublin Airport was, again, confusing. It had tons of terminals/zones and I wasn't sure where to go when I got there. I was instantly surprised by the Gaelic everywhere...totally wasn't expecting as much Gaelic in Ireland as there was. I texted Kristina (who I was here to visit) and she found travel plans to our AirBnB for me to follow. It was only 10 Euro to get from the airport to our AirBnB...not sure how to feel about that since they have 10 Euro buses that go from Dublin to Limerick. Anyway, they said to find Zone 19 at the station and I COULDN'T FIND IT FOR THE LIFE OF ME. It was 10:20 and I was searching but couldn't find it. The bus left at 10:39, so I was freaking out (in typical Bobby fashion). Eventually, I found a guy selling tickets and asked him where Zone 19 was. He looked at me like I was crazy and said the bus would stop at Zone 21 (where I was). I don't think there was a Zone 19 after all. Still, I waited at Zone 21 and as 10:45 rolled around I started to freak out. "WAS THE BUS GOING TO COME OR DID I MISS IT," I thought to myself. Luckily (ha, Irish and luck), It came around 10:50 and I hopped aboard. I guess punctuality isn't exactly a thing in Ireland like it is in Germany.</p>

<p>I pulled up to the Blackrock Shopping Center where I was supposed to get off, stumbled out half asleep, and started walking the 2200m distance to our AirBnB. It was a nice walk. The area was pretty, it was quiet, and the weather wasn't too cold. Once I finally got there, I looked in the window, saw Kristina and Cody, and they came to my rescue! I got in, we talked about all sorts of non-sense (mostly Denison gossip because Kristina and Cody are like the Gretchen Weiners of Denison) and made it to bed. It was nice to see familiar faces and be able to catch up.</p>

We woke up early the next day at my bidding (I don't wanna waste a day in Ireland!) and hustled to catch the bus into downtown Dublin. We were hungry, so we decided to grab a breakfast (a full Irish breakfast, ooo!). We stopped at a little place inside a shopping center (I know, I know...super authentic) and ordered. It was so weird not having to worry about ordering in German. We got a free coffee with the meal which was nice and we enjoyed the food. There was a metric shitton of meat that came with the breakfast (ham, pudding, sausage) and it was really greasy. I'm still baffled that Americans are given the reputation of having terrible diets. Like really? The Dutch eat nothing but cheese and bread and the Irish load their plates with friggin' greasy meat and we're the unhealthy ones? Okay. Sure.

We didn't waste much time eating though. We caught the fist bus we saw headed for downtown and paid our 2 Euros for the ride there.
