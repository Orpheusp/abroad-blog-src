<p>While it’s certainly not the most exciting destination, I made the decision to go to Osnabrück…and it honestly wasn’t too bad! We found lots to do in Osnabrück, things to see, and weird art museums to go to. Thank God for free travel via our SemesterPass.</p>

<p>When we first boarded the train, things were looking up. Soon after, these young parents and their 3 kids entered the train. Oh no. The entire duration of the trip to Osnabrück the kids screamed and yelled and it was miserable. Even more unfortunate was the fact that I didn’t have my earbuds, so I had to rawdawg the entire train ride with the children yelling. Ugh.</p>

<p>However, I <em>did</em> make it to Osnabrück alive and without killing anyone…thankfully. When we got there, we didn’t really have a plan…we never really do. So, we decided to just kind of walk around until we came up with a plan. We knew for sure that we were hungry so we stopped to get some Asian food. Problem was, nobody there spoke English. Naturally, this wasn’t too big of a problem for Daniel and me. We both ordered in German and tried to answer any questions they had in German. Pretty decent. Thura, however, doesn’t speak any German…so that was a struggle. It was hard enough understanding what he wanted in English so we could translate it to German for us. In the end, we managed to get everything correct (even after the Asian guys got mad at Daniel for taking the wrong meal at first).</p>

<p>When we left a river appeared soon after so we walked along that until we started seeing cathedrals all over the place and decided to get a little bit more adventurous with our exploring. Knowing how important our knowledge of German is, Daniel and I decided to institute mandatory 15 minute German speaking periods every hour which really made Thura mad… oh well. We decided at some random point to head for the botanical gardens and made our way along a path. We took several detours; on one of them we saw a cool question door and got pictures with it. German backroads are really cool and historic looking. After walking through lots of muddy paths to get to the botanical gardens, we get to the gate to see it is closed. Some <em>really</em> old guy running by saw us at the gate and yelled in German that it was close. Daniel said we didn’t speak German so he (surprisingly) told us it was closed in English and ran off. I never would have expected some old guy to be able to speak English!</p>
