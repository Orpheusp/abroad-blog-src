<p>So, before I leave for Israel I want it to be known and understood that I'm going to have a week's worth of writing ahead of me and it's highly possible that it could take me a while to get it into writing. I'm going to try my best to not just list out things that happened or speed though the posts because it's going to be an awesome trip. But just a forewarning.</p>
