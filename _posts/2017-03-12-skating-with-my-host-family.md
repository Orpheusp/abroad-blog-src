Not much to say here. I just wanted to keep this update. Jacob and I went ice skating with our host family which wasn't 100% painful...I did remember how not great I am at skating though, haha. When we left, we took the tram back to the Bremen Hbf, Jacob left early for some reason and then we made our way for my host family's house. On the way, some random guy must have heard us speaking English and gave us a 2 Euro piece and told us (in German, mind you) to enjoy Bremen. It was weird. But hey, we were 2 Euro richer!

At home, we played German scrabble (I died) and ate dinner. After a quick walk, it was late and I had to go home. Not a lot happened. So yeah, the end.
