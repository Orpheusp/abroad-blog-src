<p>Another quick little post. Went for my second haircut in Europe. The first one, if you'll remember from the 'Dam post, was in Amsterdam and cost an arm and a leg. This second haircut was in Germany (Vegesack to be exact), was just as wonderful, but it was significantly cheaper and I had to tell them what I wanted in German. I was super nervous the entire time. I hate speaking German to people who don't speak a lick of English, so I warned the barber-person that my German was bad and he was super nice through the entire process. I would really recommend the place to any students in the area&mdash;great service and great haircut!</p>
